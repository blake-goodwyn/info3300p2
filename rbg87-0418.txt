* Describe what you have done over the past week
-After exploring various datasets, including generating our own from a web crawler, we have honed in on the domain of movies and cinema. One idea that was brought up was a quiz visualization, one that prompts the user with questions and changes accordingly. I have generated a mock pie chart that transitions based on random data. It is our hope that this will serve as a mock-up for out final project.


* Describe your plans for the next week
-Finalizing idea and obtain relevant data from either web crawler or IMDB.
-Finish mock-up design, evaluate complexity, and iterate.
